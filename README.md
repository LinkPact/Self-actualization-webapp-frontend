# Self-actualization-webapp-frontend
This web app is being developed to help the developers (and hopefully lots of other people) to live more in line with our values and to provide motivation to do so.

The basic idea is this: when you sign up you define your _values_. Values are things you find important in life and motivates your actions. Some examples are being healthy or contributing to society. The term value is used loosely here to refer to something that gives you motivation, so it's completely fine to set a goal, like getting a job, or a need, like recognition, as a value.

When you've defined your values, you can start setting up _habits_ and _milestones_. These are motivated by your values and should serve to reinforce those values and let you know that you are on the right track to live a more fulfilled life.

When you have defined some habits and/or milestones, you simply check in to the web app regularly and check off the habits/milestones you have completed.

Let's give an example of how the values, habits and milestones are related. Say you set being healthy as one of your values. You could then set a habit to take a walk everyday. This habit, if followed, let's you begin to realize living a life with the thing you value: being healthy. But it might also be motivating to have a concrete goal you can aim for. This is where milestones come in. In this example, you could set a milestone to start going to the gym. Besides serving as motivation to reach the milestone, it will feel as a great accomplishment when you _do_ reach it. This will serve to further reinforce your motivation to continue living in accordance with your values.
